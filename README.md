### Product Inspiration
As a guitarist and pianist, I had often looked for an online guitar-to-piano converter, but was disappointed by the lack of any free, user-friendly options. I knew I could do better. I created an efficient, responsive, and easy-to-use product that lets guitar players of all skill levels translate their chords to piano with ease.
